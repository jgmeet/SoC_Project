# Intro to Full Stack Web Development

The objective is to introduce you to Full Stack Web Development and build a project to utilise the skills learned. We'll cover the essentials from scratch using the MERN stack - MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Starting with HTML and CSS, you will gain a solid understanding of web design before delving into JavaScript fundamentals. Moving on, we'll tackle server-side programming with Node.js and Express, along with Git for code management. Hands-on experience with MongoDB for database management and user authentication will follow. Then, we'll dive into React for dynamic user interfaces and Redux for state management. Finally, you will build a website from scratch, covering everything from planning to deployment.
